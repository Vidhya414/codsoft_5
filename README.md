This project aims to build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. 
The dataset contains information about various transactions, and the goal is to classify each transaction as either fraudulent or genuine.
Given the class imbalance in the dataset (fraudulent transactions are rare), special attention is paid to handling this imbalance to ensure the model's effectiveness.
